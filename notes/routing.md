# Routing

## Types of Routing

1. Index-based routes: `index` component in pages folder/subfolders becomes default root route

2. Nested routes: `/coffee-store`

3. Dynamic routes: defined brackets: `/coffee-store/[id]`

## Types of Linking

1. Non-dynamic/known pages: `<Link to=<route-name> />`
2. Dynamic pages: `<Link to=<route-name/[value]> />`
