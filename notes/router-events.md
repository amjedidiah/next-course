# Router Events

The router emits navigation events through the `Router.events` property. These events range from when the navigation starts and ends to many points in between. The full list of navigation events is displayed [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router#routerevents).

> This is useful for redirecting the user to a login page if they are not authenticated.
